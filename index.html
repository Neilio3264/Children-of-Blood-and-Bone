								<p>There is very little point in me "clearing my throat", so I'll ask you <i>why does it matter that there is oppression in the world</i>.</p>
								<p>As disheartening as it may be, a simple answer to the question could be the biography of Trayvon Martin. Many of you may have forgotten of the insident that accorded almost 6 years ago from today. Trayvon was a young 17 year old who had many aspirations. <span class="image main"><img src="images/trayvon-martin.jpg" alt="" /></span>Unfortunately, biased views, and dare I say it, rascism caused a simple trip to 7-11 to be costly. His full biography can be found <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/trayvon-martin-21283721" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
								<p>So why bring up his story? Police brutality and oppression are serious issues that developed countries like ours are yet to overcome. It seems as though many thoughts of todays world follow the Jim Crow laws of the past. However, many of us fear outcomes when corrilating such events to reason. I simply couldn't comprehend why <i>racism</i> proved to be so contraversial. But even I overlooked any thought on the issue until a very recent book I read. <i>Children of Blood and Bone</i> is a fictional story written by Tomi Adeyemi held in African territory. However, what blew me away was the significance of the story's location relative to this theme was, literally, magically depicted. Adeyemi's novel grapples with lives in a black community after a fatal shooting by a police officer. She herself stated that she again, and again, and again fond herself in a place of being enraged, full of grief and terrified. The rage and the grief were obvious, but she also spoke of a fear that is often overlooked. Tomi Adeyemi says to write about this fear she drew on her experience of being black in America in a time of high-profile police shootings of unarmed black men. One passage describing Zelie's panic was essentially a diary entry she wrote after the killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. Much like Trayvon, their stories came to an unnecassary end.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/friendship.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This image above is the perfect representation of an ideal that Adeyemi portrayed beautifully. Zelie, one of the main protagonists, finds an opportunity to restore magic to her people. She jumps at the chance, helped by her brother and the king's daughter they are able to breathe a new light of magnificence. This story relates so well to the oppression we face today when you analyze the monarch. In the book, a cruel and oppressive king rules Orisha, and he hates maji who are accussed of being dangerous as a minority and shunned with every instance. By the end of the book, we see Zelie able to overcome many negativities in her life as she is able bind new ties to the monarch itself along her long journey. Even so, constantly this oppression drives her down almost dehumanizing her. This Prejudice was often driven by fear, but it only created even more fear.</p>
								<p>Today, social media plays a similar role. We now are able to put a face on many issues. Before the use of social media, there was always a sense of certanty that overcame all individuals. I'm sure we can all agree that we were a bit more "carefree". Once that all changed we were heavly influenced by what we see on the internet which drove many of us into an era of social media movements. As we continue to personify such movements, a large majority of us continue to turn heads. For example, police brutality is commonly seen as an oppressive force that must be stopped, however, its tie to that very deparment is what drives us away from action. Although, much like Zelie's journey, the road to change in our oppressive society is not an easy one, we must be willing to unmask its malicious presence to change the lives of many.</p>

								<h2 class="major">November 13, 2018</h2>
								<p>Another beautiful day here in Austin! Just gets my day going. Oh, that and some jams.</p>
								<p>Speaking of, I recently listened to NWA - F*** The Police. Censored of course. But man is that a classic. I have to say though, Mrs. Cooley really has gotten me to the point of analyzing everything. When I listened to it this time, all I thought about was how it actually realted to my book <i>Children of Blood and Bone</i>. To be fair, they are both about inequality. I mean the song obviously, but the book as well. Let me give you a quick run down.</p>
								<p>In the fictional country of Orïsha, society is sharply stratified by a system that pits maji, who do magic, and divîners, who have the potential to do magic, against kosidán, who cannot perform magic. Because those with magical abilities are seen as dangerous, divîners are treated as inferior and even inhuman.</p>
								<p>As rude as this may sound, it definetly screams African American oppression to me. For the sake of keeping this journal "clean" I won't include the lyrics cause they are self-explainitory. They do mostly revolve around the amount of gang violence in LA at the time though. Many people in the area had little faith in the police department and others alike since they recieved very little aid and were feared. Now that I think of it, that sounds exactly like Zelie's remarks from Chapter 2 of the book "He wants to believe that playing by the monarchy’s rules will keep us safe, but nothing can protect us when those rules are rooted in hate".</p>
								<p>I hate to turn things dark but I have to include this one point. There was an interesting quote from Inan in Chapter 54 of him saying "A pit of guilt opens in my chest, tainted with the smell of burning flesh. The fires I watched from the royal palace resurface, the innocent lives burned before my young eyes. A memory I’ve pushed down like my magic, a day I longed to forget. But staring at Zélie now brings it all back: the pain. The tears. The death." This quote reminds me of significant the change was around the era of the music video release by NWA. Hip Hop saw a major shift in America where the "truths" of many forces at hand within our our government were depicted. Inan's thought reveals exactly what happened, however. The movement was not nearly as large enough as Hip Hop never grew to fame that made a major difference. Oppression continued and it wasn't until social media that individuals could really make a movement big.</p>
								<p>In both the book and the events occuring around the song perfectly illustrated how the journey is what created more of an impact as greater number of interactions and growth of social media were able to kick off realizations of both situations. Others were able to relate to Zelie which aided her in the push for a nonoppressive monarch while the Hip Hop era revolving NWA's release proved to shine light to situations and finally understood as movements such as #BLACKLIVESMATTER developed.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Is Nigerian Culture Loved?</h2>
								<h5>By Neil Rathod <i>2/11/2019</i></h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nigerian.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Have you ever imagined the world of <i>Harry Potter</i> cross paths with minority movements such as Black Lives Matter? Tomi Adeyemi's highly anticipated debut novel, Children Of Blood And Bone, is a high fantasy rooted in reality achieving just that. What's more is that we finally are entertained to such a book where the protagonist and author are deeply rooted</p>

								<h3>Early Life</h3>
								<p>Tomi Adeyemi was born in the US in 1993. Being a first generation meant that she had less time learning Nigerian culture and language. This was because her parents, despite her father being a qualified physician, had a tough time finding employment that would acknowledge their background. It took a significant amount of time for their stature to transfer from Nigeria. This forced the Adeyemi’s in a financial struggle with her father working as a taxi driver and mother as a cleaning women. As far as Tomi was concerned, her parents never bothered to expose her to another culture since adapting for her would prove to be a greater challenge than it already was.</p>

								<blockquote cite="https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/adjusting-new-culture">"Once in the U.S. participants face an adjustment period referred to as 'culture shock.' Moving to the U.S.can be a very stressful experience. Everything is unfamiliar; from weather, landscape and language to food, fashion, values, and customs."</blockquote>

								<h3>Zelie's Relation to Tomi</h3>
								<p>Tomi pictured this book to be a representation of teenage black society. Even the smaller detail such as the way Zelie's hair is described in the book is often what is corelated to African appearances. Besides the obvious general appearances. One of the biggest similarities is the power that Zelie holds. Life and Death. Do to the conditions in which Tomi grew up in as well as few controversies in her career, she has, at times, fallen into a state of depression. She has said in an interview with Mallory Yu that "Death is something that I am still trying to figure out a healthy relationship with." Zelies constant internal struggles also grows inspiration from this aspect of Tomi's life.</p>
								<p>Her distance from Nigerian culture can also be seen throughout the book. Zelie herself enjoys all there is to magic as she believes it defines her as an individual and divîner. However, she remains distant from this root of hers for much of the story until she begins her quest to revive magic through the 3 sacred items. Much like Tomi, she was seperate from her Nigerian background for much of her life. Once she began to study her culture through a fellowship, to her pleasant surprise, she loved what she truly was. She even later went on to write a book about the love of her culture as a whole.</p>

								<br>
								<p>Zelie's character in the book <i>Children of Blood and Bone</i> exemplifies Tomi's life as an individual learning truths that she never knew existed. This goes to show that although you may think the truth is obsolete due to ones childhood growth, there is often more to an individuals character than that of which is portrayed or thought of.</p>
